A _source_ in Skillforest is a source of information that you use to learn about a topic. These are things you'll be working with the most in here.

This page is itself a Skillforest source about "the concept of source in Skillforest".

This separation between sources and topics is important in order to allow _flexibility_ in the learning process. As long as a topic is _defined the same way_ in different sources, it doesn't matter which one you learned it from. But one and the same topic can be *explained* differently in different sources:

- they may use different approaches, examples or analogies
- they may use different media, e. g. audio, video, text
- they may be authored in different languages, e. g. English or Mandarin Chinese

How you "use" a page to learn is also not defined, and that is deliberate left to the author of the source to define. A simplest case would be to just read and understand what's on the page. But webpages can feature interactive demos, videos, links to external sources, self-check exercises or, hypothetically, some videoconferencing app that gets you in touch with someone familiar with the subject. That last one would seem impractical to me, but hey, maybe someone can turn that idea in a better direction.

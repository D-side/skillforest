A requirement is a type of link between a topic and a source that tells Skillforest that marking the source as read you assert that you know the associated topic.

Many sources, especially those written specifically for use with Skillforest, only cover a single topic and thus only include one result. This is intentional, it helps people go through only the information they need in the moment without wasting time on topics they _might_ need later.

However, sources can't always be cleanly broken down into to individual topics without making them hard to identify. References to specific paragraphs of the chapter would be difficult to later follow. So

And Skillforest makes sure the small pictures eventually form a bigger one with no blanks. That's the intention anyway. But it heavily relies on the quality of sources to function well.

A requirement is a type of link between a concept and a source that tells Skillforest that this source **should not be shown** until a certain other concept is understood first.

If you're following the Skillforest tutorial, you may have noticed that the interface did not show you a link to this page when you first opened the app. That link only appeared once you've read about sources and concepts and let the app know of it â€” that's exactly what requirements do.

By now you should have a basic understanding of what a **source** is:

- A link to a specific page
- A set of required topics that determine when that link should be shown
- A set of resulting topics the user would learn about after going through the page

The basic process of using Skillforest goes as follows:

- Add a goal to the app.
- Open the tab of current sources (⏯) if it's not already open
- Repeat:
  - If the app is showing you sources, open one of them. It doesn't matter if it's the first one or not — **all** the current sources are the ones you're ready for, i. e. where you've satisfied all the requirements.
  - Read and understand the source you've opened.
  - Come back to the app and hit a checkmark next to the source you've gone through.
- If the app isn't showing you any sources, then you've reached your goals!

This does leave out a few corner cases, but with well-built sources you shouldn't run into any issues with the loop above.

**Goals** in Skillforest are *sources* you wish to eventually understand, and the reason you're using the app: to guide you through the steps that will get you there.

If you're reading this while following the Skillforest tutorial, then you've probably set ["Skillforest: Introduction"](Introduction) as a **goal**. The app will present you with the steps you need to follow to reach it.

You can even pursue _multiple goals_ at a time if you want to, but I recommend exploring the basics first. This won't take long!
